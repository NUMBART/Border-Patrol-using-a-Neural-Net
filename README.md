# Border Patrol using a Neural Network in C++

In this repository I have added files which 
1) *Data Extraction* - Extract country name from geo-coordinates of points(neighbouring the Indo-Pak border) using Geonames Webservices.
2) *Neural Network in C++* - Implement a simple Neural Network coded in C++ trained on the above data.
3) *Alert Generator* - Raise alert using the network if points are detected too close to the border.
4) *Plotting Points* - Also added files to generate commands that runs on GNU Octave for visualizing the points. [Click here](https://octave-online.net/) to run the commands in your browser.
---
**Data Extraction**
- Start Point for Border - Required for ii) and iii) to find starting point of border and vertices of area where sample will be collected respectively
- Trace Border - Points along the border are printed to find a suitable place to train network
- Point Generator - Generates points for training and testing samples.
	
**Neural Network in C++**
- domainConv.cpp - preprocesses the training sample to get rid of unnecessary part of lattiude and longitude
- border_NN.cpp - Implementation of neural network to be trained
- shuffler.cpp - can be used to reshuffle training data(trainer.txt)
	
**Alert Generator**
- prepTester.cpp - prepares testing data(the country codes are removed)
- minmax.cpp - minimum and maximum latitudes for training data are found(required for converting back from preprocessed data)
- calcMan - detects the points from testing sample which are too close to the border(weights from border_NN.cpp used)
	
**Sample Files for convenience**
- weights.txt, weightsCopy.txt, wrongOutputs.txt, wrongOutputsCopy.txt are all generated by border_NN.cpp. The first two contain the trained weights, while the last two are list of points that give wrong predictions.
- unprocessedTrainer.txt is input to domainConv.cpp and its ouput is stored in trainer.txt, which is input to border_NN.cpp.
- unprocessedTester.txt is input to prepTester.cpp and its ouput is stored in tester.txt, which is input to calcMan.cpp. calcMan.cpp stores the points on alert in alertFile.txt.
	
**Octave - Plotting Points**
- pravmat.cpp - takes in a copy of alertFile.txt and generates a list of commands for Octave which are redirected and stored in prav.txt
- pravmatCoun.cpp - takes in a copy of unprocessedTrainer.txt and generates a list of commands for Octave which are redirected and stored in prav.txt
